I am a research scientist with a PhD in computational and applied mathematics from Mines Saint-Étienne. My work focuses on developing advanced image analysis and machine learning methods for materials characterization.

My areas of expertise include stochastic geometry, computer vision, and their applications in fields such as process engineering and materials science. I am particularly drawn to solving complex data analysis problems involving images and 3D geometrical structures, while also exploring broader aspects of artificial intelligence—such as machine learning, deep learning, and data science—and their transformative impact on the world.

# Research interests

My research interests focus on developing innovative methods to characterize the morphology of complex granular objects like aggregates:

- Designing stochastic geometrical 3D models to generate realistic virtual aggregates with tunable morphological properties
- Using deep learning techniques like GANs and CNNs for instance segmentation of aggregates in 2D images
- Combining image analysis, stochastic modeling and machine learning to estimate 3D morphological descriptors of aggregates from 2D projected data
- Applying these tools to better understand and control industrial granular processes (particle aggregation, powder flowability, etc.)
