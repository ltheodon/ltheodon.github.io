I am a PhD student working on the morphological characterization of granular materials, particularly aggregates and agglomerates, using image analysis and stochastic 3D models. My research combines approaches from computer science, applied mathematics and chemical engineering.

# Research interests

My research interests focus on developing innovative methods to characterize the morphology of complex granular objects like aggregates:

- Designing stochastic geometrical 3D models to generate realistic virtual aggregates with tunable morphological properties
- Using deep learning techniques like GANs and CNNs for instance segmentation of aggregates in 2D images
- Combining image analysis, stochastic modeling and machine learning to estimate 3D morphological descriptors of aggregates from 2D projected data
- Applying these tools to better understand and control industrial granular processes (particle aggregation, powder flowability, etc.)
